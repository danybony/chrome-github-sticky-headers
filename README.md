# Deprecated
Since March 2019 this feature is natively integrated on GitHub so this extension is no longer needed.

...unfortunately this is not always the case.<br/>
This chrome extension helps you reviewing those 1000 loc files having the current file header always visible while scrolling through the page.

**NEW**: you can now collapse and expand some or all of the changed files.

##Development

You need to have NodeJS with `grunt-cli` and `bower` installed.

```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

To debug the application with a live reload mechanism, run:

```shell
$ grunt debug
```

Then add the `app` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
